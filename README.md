**Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python**
This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects based on the transcripts of 21 popular stand-up comedians. The aim is to explore and analyze comedic text using a variety of NLP techniques.

üìÅ Project Structure
The repository is organized into five python Notebooks, each focusing on a specific part of the NLP pipeline:

1. NLP_in_python_1.ipynb
Preprocesses the raw transcripts by removing noise, normalizing text, and preparing it for analysis.

2. NLP_in_Python_2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb
Visualizes key statistics like word counts, most frequent words, and patterns across comedians.

3. NLP_in_Python_3_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
Analyzes the sentiment of jokes and monologues to find trends in positive/negative expressions.

4. NLP_in_Python_4_(Topic_Modeling).ipynb
Uses LDA and/or NMF to identify major topics in the comedians' material.

5. NLP_in_Python_5_(Text_Generation).ipynb
Generates new stand-up style text using language models trained on the transcripts.
